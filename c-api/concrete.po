"The functions in this chapter are specific to certain Python object types. "
"Passing them an object of the wrong type is not a good idea; if you receive "
"an object from a Python program and you are not sure that it has the right "
"type, you must perform a type check first; for example, to check that an "
"object is a dictionary, use :c:func:`PyDict_Check`.  The chapter is "
"structured like the \"family tree\" of Python object types."

"While the functions described in this chapter carefully check the type of "
"the objects which are passed in, many of them do not check for ``NULL`` "
"being passed instead of a valid object.  Allowing ``NULL`` to be passed in "
"can cause memory access violations and immediate termination of the "
"interpreter."
