"Python supports *weak references* as first-class objects.  There are two "
"specific object types which directly implement weak references.  The first "
"is a simple reference object, and the second acts as a proxy for the "
"original object as much as it can."

"Return a weak reference object for the object *ob*.  This will always return "
"a new reference, but is not guaranteed to create a new object; an existing "
"reference object may be returned.  The second parameter, *callback*, can be "
"a callable object that receives notification when *ob* is garbage collected; "
"it should accept a single parameter, which will be the weak reference object "
"itself. *callback* may also be ``None`` or ``NULL``.  If *ob* is not a "
"weakly referencable object, or if *callback* is not callable, ``None``, or "
"``NULL``, this will return ``NULL`` and raise :exc:`TypeError`."
