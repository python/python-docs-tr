"This module provides support for maintaining a list in sorted order without "
"having to sort the list after each insertion.  For long lists of items with "
"expensive comparison operations, this can be an improvement over the more "
"common approach.  The module is called :mod:`bisect` because it uses a basic "
"bisection algorithm to do its work.  The source code may be most useful as a "
"working example of the algorithm (the boundary conditions are already "
"right!)."

"Locate the insertion point for *x* in *a* to maintain sorted order. The "
"parameters *lo* and *hi* may be used to specify a subset of the list which "
"should be considered; by default the entire list is used.  If *x* is already "
"present in *a*, the insertion point will be before (to the left of) any "
"existing entries.  The return value is suitable for use as the first "
"parameter to ``list.insert()`` assuming that *a* is already sorted."
msgstr ""

#: library/bisect.rst:33

"The returned insertion point *i* partitions the array *a* into two halves so "

">= x for val in a[i : hi])`` for the right side."

"*key* specifies a :term:`key function` of one argument that is used to "
"extract a comparison key from each element in the array.  To support "
"searching complex records, the key function is not applied to the *x* value."

"Bisection is effective for searching ranges of values. For locating specific "

"The *insort()* functions are ``O(n)`` because the logarithmic search step is "
"dominated by the linear time insertion step."

#: library/bisect.rst:119
msgid ""
"The search functions are stateless and discard key function results after "
"they are used.  Consequently, if the search functions are used in a loop, "
"the key function may be called again and again on the same array elements. "
"If the key function isn't fast, consider wrapping it with :func:`functools."
"cache` to avoid duplicate computations.  Alternatively, consider searching "
"an array of precomputed keys to locate the insertion point (as shown in the "
"examples section below)."
