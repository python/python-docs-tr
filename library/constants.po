"The false value of the :class:`bool` type. Assignments to ``False`` are "

"An object frequently used to represent the absence of a value, as when "
"default arguments are not passed to a function. Assignments to ``None`` are "
"illegal and raise a :exc:`SyntaxError`. ``None`` is the sole instance of "

"A special value which should be returned by the binary special methods (e."
"g. :meth:`__eq__`, :meth:`__lt__`, :meth:`__add__`, :meth:`__rsub__`, etc.) "
"to indicate that the operation is not implemented with respect to the other "
"type; may be returned by the in-place binary special methods (e.g. :meth:"
"`__imul__`, :meth:`__iand__`, etc.) for the same purpose. It should not be "
"evaluated in a boolean context. ``NotImplemented`` is the sole instance of "
"the :data:`types.NotImplementedType` type."

"When a binary (or in-place) method returns ``NotImplemented`` the "
"interpreter will try the reflected operation on the other type (or some "
"other fallback, depending on the operator).  If all attempts return "
"``NotImplemented``, the interpreter will raise an appropriate exception. "
"Incorrectly returning ``NotImplemented`` will result in a misleading error "
"message or the ``NotImplemented`` value being returned to Python code."
